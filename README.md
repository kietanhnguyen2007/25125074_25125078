Personal Finance Manager is a console-based C++ application that allows users
to manage personal financial activities, including income, expenses, recurring
transactions, and wallets.

# Build
Compile the program using a C++ compiler (C++17 or later is recommended):

# Run
When the program starts, the dashboard displays the current balance of all
wallets. Users can navigate through the menu to:

- Add and manage income and expense transactions
- Configure recurring monthly transactions
- Manage wallets, income sources, and expense categories
- View financial statistics by time range, wallet, or year

All changes are saved automatically, and data is preserved across sessions.

# Storage
The application uses binary file storage to save all financial data. Stored
data is automatically loaded at startup, ensuring that no information is lost
between sessions.
